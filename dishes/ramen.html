                <ol>
                    1.Stir-Fry Aromatics: Garlic and ginger, what a delicious duo. This is where the flavor is, friends.
                    <br>
                    2.Make Your (Easy!) Broth: Add some chicken broth and dried shiitake mushrooms for some umami punch.
                    <br>
                    3.Add Noodles: Cook your noodles right in the broth with some scallions (more flavor, please!).
                    <br>
                    4.Add Veg: Thinly sliced kale, shredded carrots, whatever you’d like! Cook until just tender.
                    <br>
                    5.Top It Off: Add some crunchy panko crumbs, a soft-boiled egg, chili oil, hot sauce, sesame oil, and/or soy sauce, whatever your heart desires.
